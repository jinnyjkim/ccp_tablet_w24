            <img src="images/sage_classic.jpeg" width = "400" alt="A smiling golden retriever lying on the bed">

            <p>Sage is a 3 year old golden retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking into the bedrom and hopping onto the neatest bed. she also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup of tea.</p> 
            <P>Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which was surprising because she is normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended up vomiting it all later.</P>

            <img src = "images/van_gogh_on_fridge.jpg" width = "400" alt = "Ragdoll cat sitting on top of black fridge">

            <p>Van Gosh is a 3 year old cat of mixed ragdoll and domestic shorthair breed. He was adopted when he was 7 months old. Van Gogh has been a people cat since he was young. He craves attention but needs alone time when he wants it. He is purely a masterpiece when his sapphire eyes stare at his human friends. He loves birds, rats, insects, and water from human mugs.</p>
            <p>Van Gogh is responsible for his household safety, but he gets scared when the vacuum machines wakes up. He tries his best to make defense but his beautiful fur coat gets messed up immediately when he gets too close. By the way, he likes his fur coat being brushed by himself. He bites when he does not get enough attention, but he always gets what he wants.</p>
